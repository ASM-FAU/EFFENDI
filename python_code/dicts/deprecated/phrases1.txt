my watch fell in the water
prevailing wind from the east
never too rich and never too thin
breathing is difficult
physics and chemistry are hard
my bank account is overdrawn
elections bring out the best
we are having spaghetti
time to go shopping
elephants are afraid of mice
my favorite place to visit
three two one zero blast off
my favorite subject is psychology
watch out for low flying objects
please provide your date of birth
we run the risk of failure
prayer in schools offends some
he is just like everyone else
great disturbance in the force
would you like to come to my house
no kissing in the library
electric cars need big fuel cells
a steep learning curve in riding a unicycle
a good stimulus deserves a good response
why do you ask silly questions
